# Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset detailing electric vehicles (EV) registrations across the United States, with a focused case study on Washington State. By examining regional adoption patterns, vehicles type distribution, and manufacturer trends, the goal is to generate actionable insights into EV growth, infrastructure requirement, and evolving market preferences. Washington serves as an ideal focal point due to its rich dataset and significant EV adoption, allowing us to conduct a deep dive analysis into electric vehicles.

# Objective
**EV Adoption Trends** <br>
Track EV growth over time and identify leading regions (states/counties) in adoption.<br>  
**Market Insights** <br>
Understand which EV brands and models are most popular, and how preferences vary regionally. <br>  
**EV Type Distribution** <br>
Analyze the ratio between BEVs and PHEVs and explore how it differs by location and manufacturer. <br>  

# Key Insights
*	**King County** accounts for the majority of EV registrations in Washington, representing approximately **54.93%** of the state's total, followed by Snohomish **(12.08%)** and Pierce Counties **(8.46%)**. These three counties make up over **75%** of the state's EV population. 

*	**Tesla** leads the EV market in Washington by a significant margin, accounting approximately **45.83%** of total EV registrations, far surpassing other manufacturers.

*	**Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** make up **79.29%** of the total EV population in Washington, while **Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)** represent **20.71%**. This highlights a strong consumer preference for fully electric vehicles.

*	**BEVs** have shown a noticeable acceleration in growth from **2020 to 2023**, showing a clear market shift away from PHEVs.

* **Rural counties** significantly lag behind urban centers in EV adoption, these is likely tied down to factors which includes income levels, charging availability, and population density.

# Recommendation
1. **Expand Charging Infrastructure**
Focus on counties like King, Snohomish, and Pierce that have high EV concentration. These areas will require more charging stations to meet current and future demand.

2. **Support Underserved Regions**
While King dominates, for other counties especially neighboring counties that are showing steady growth, investing in awareness campaigns and infrastructure in these areas can encourage EV adoption.

3. **Monitor and Respond to Market Trends**
Track local preference and trends to guide decisions such as promoting high-range BEVs in rural areas or supporting popular brands with service centers and dealership.

4. **Tailoring Incentives to Local Market Needs**
Customizing business incentives like rebates and free charging based on what each specific region actually needs to boost EV adoption. This helps to remove barriers like costing concerns and limited access to charging stations.
